This repository contains the code for the website http://caffe.help, a website
intended to improve the documentation for the caffe deep learning framework.

It is based off of the
[Feeling Responsive](https://github.com/Phlow/feeling-responsive/)
Jekyll template.

This project requires a version of the Caffe repository. Caffe.help uses https://github.com/caffe-help/caffe.
